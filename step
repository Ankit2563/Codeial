SCSS and SASS

Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

Sass has two syntaxes! The SCSS syntax (.scss) is used most commonly. Itâ€™s a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS. The indented syntax (.sass) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available in both syntaxes.

installing sass->npm install node-sass-middleware
